Welcome! You have reached the diy diabetes directory, a github repository for listing out and categorizing many solutions that are diy-diabetes related in some way.

**What is diy diabetes?**
It's when you develop or create any software that is designed to help someone with type one diabetes, usually by communicating with medical devices- BUT it is not FDA approved, not developed by a large corporation, but is instead usually made by one or a few developers. **The result is solutions that people want, for free, created by the people who actually use them.

The biggest example of this is Dana Lewis and #openAPS, and the Nightscout foundation. But over time, as I researched, I discovered there are hundreds of projects, small and large, that are incredibly helpful, but only a select few know that they actually exist.

Mainly, because, if you search Google for these things, it doesn't show up in a clear way. If you search 'diy closed loop omnipod' you wouldn't know that actually, yes, [you can closed loop with the omnipod using omnipy](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy).

If you search 'dexcom direct to apple watch' you would discover that dexcom never delivered on a huge promise, but also you might not necessarily figure out that [you can do the same thing with android wear](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/blob/master/Documentation/WatchGuide.md#enable-xdrip-android-wear-integration).

This repository aims to change that. Currently a github wiki, this directory of sorts will list as many diy solutions as possible, but in an order that makes sense, clearly categorized, with a concise description.
